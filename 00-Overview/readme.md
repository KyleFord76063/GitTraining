Overview
========

> Git is distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Now, this is great and all, but what it means? Here are some points some people have problem getting about git:

* everything related to git repository is stored in `.git` folder in root of your project; you can just copy project folder and git repository will travel with it
* from technical standpoint, there is no central repository, all repositories are equal
* usually there is one `upstream`, but which repository it is depends on agreement between project members
* this has some (maybe) unexpected side effects
	* you cannot restrict read access to specific files, folders, branches; if you want someone to clone from you, he has to be able to get everything
	* everyone has complete history of the project

All repositories are equal
--------------------------

* while you do clone from somewhere, you are not restricted to pushing/pulling from there
* you have a colleague who made some useful class but it's not ready to be pushed upstream yet? Don't worry, you can pull it directly from him

Restricting access
------------------

* you cannot restrict **read** access to files, directories or branches
	* this can sometimes be problem in corporate environment for direct migration from SVN/TFS to git
* it **is** possible to restrict **write** access
	* git has ability to be extended by hooks, so you can restrict write and/or check other stuff
		* for example, you can verify that commit contains WIT number and reject it otherwise

Everyone has complete history
-----------------------------

* this is very important point
* I'm sure it happened to you at least once, you commit password into source control
	* if someone already cloned/pulled from you, all you can do is change it
	* committing new version without the password won't help you, because everyone has complete history, each and every commit, in the local repository
* other cause where you have to remember this is if you commit some huge file (`.pdb` or something) and later down the line you notice  that your repository is huge
	* deleting the file and committing the deletion won't help (unless you rewrite history and remove the file completely from all commits, see below)
	* the file is part of the repository forever
* **history can be rewritten**, but you will break every repository that cloned from you and they will have to re-clone, losing every local branch
	* in other words, **don't ever rewrite history unless you know what you are doing**

Commit & history integrity
--------------------------

* in git you don't have revision numbers (as in TFS or SVN), instead git uses SHA-1 hashes to mark commits
* each file in your repository is represented by it's SHA-1 checksum
* part of chechsummed git commit is checksum of previous commits, so it forms cryptographically secure line from root commit to current state
	* this means that if you have repository at the same commit as someone else and no local changes, you can be (pretty) sure you have the exact same files

What is branch in git
---------------------

* branch is really just a pointer to a commit
* difference between branch and tag is that the branch is updated to new commit when you commit into it
* so each branch isn't separate directory like in SVN/TFS
* you can have only one branch checked-out at the momment
