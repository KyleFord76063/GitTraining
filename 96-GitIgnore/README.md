.gitignore
==========

* Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore

If you have some files you don't want to track in the git repository, for example object files, you can exclude them using file “.gitignore”. Git looks for that file in following locations:

* $HOME/.config/git/ignore
	* put global stuff here (backup files created by text editor etc.)
* $GIT_DIR/info/exclude
	* put repository specific but not to be shared files here
* .gitignore
	* git looks for this file in current directory and any parent up to the root of the work tree
	* put things everyone should ignore here

Syntax
------

* use `#` at the start of a line for comments
* trailing spaces ignored unless escaped
* if you need to include previously excluded file, use `!` for that
	* it's not possible to re-include a file if parent directory was excluded
* patterns ending with slash (`/`) match only directories
* if pattern doesn't contain slash (`/`), it's used as shell glob pattern
* double asterisk `**` may have special meaning:
	* leading followed by a slash (`**/foo`) matches in all directories
	* trailing (`foo/**`) matches everything inside
	* slash + double asterisk + slash (`bar/**/foo`) matches zero or more directories
