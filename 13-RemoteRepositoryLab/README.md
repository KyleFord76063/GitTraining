# Remote Repository Lab

Now let's have some fun with a remote repository:

* Make clone of the repository:
* Create own repository on your favorite server named _aaa_.
* Change remote _origin_ URL to your new repository.
* Publish the cloned repository into your own repository.
* Now clone the repository from your account into second folder \_2
* Make this second clone active.
* To file xx.cpp add text _asdasdasd_
* Commit the file and publish it to your _origin_.
* Make the first clone active.
* Update your local repository with remote changes.
