git-merge
=========

> Join two or more development histories together

We will start with warning from documentation:

> Warning: Running git merge with non-trivial uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.

Let's all start with cloning testing repository to check merge on:

	$ git clone git@github.com:DevTrainings/test_merge_conflict.git
	$ cd test_merge_conflict
	$ git checkout bar
	$ git checkout cherry-pick
	$ git checkout foo
	$ git checkout master

This repository looks like this (run it yourself to have it in colors ;) ):

	$ git log --all --graph --oneline --decorate
	* c5d665f (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) fixed readme a bit
	| * 4909911 (origin/cherry-pick, cherry-pick) merge conflict in file
	| * e7f0e30 added file for cherry_pick
	|/  
	* 286a273 added readme
	| * c5c3da1 (origin/foo, foo) file2 for demonstration of cherry-pick
	| * c361f2e foo
	|/  
	| * bfb5647 (origin/bar, bar) bar
	|/  
	* 25f7328 file

We will ignore `cherry-pick` branch for now, we will get to it later. We have file `file` in the root directory

	$ ls -l .
	total 8
	-rw-r--r-- 1 paladin paladin  10 Apr 11 10:38 file
	-rw-r--r-- 1 paladin paladin 154 Apr 11 11:08 readme.md
	$ cat file
	.
	.
	.
	.
	.

The file `file` was changed in both branches `bar` and `foo` and we want to get those changes back into the master. We will start with `bar`

	$ git merge bar
	Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
	 file | 4 ++--
	 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)

> Running git merge with non-trivial uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.

This command produces no conflicts, since no changes we made to `file` after branching into `bar`. So after this merge, we can see that repository looks like this:

	$ git log --all --graph --oneline --decorate
	*   05dbdf3 (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'bar'
	|\  
	| * bfb5647 (origin/bar, bar) bar
	* | c5d665f (origin/master, origin/HEAD) fixed readme a bit
	| | * 4909911 (origin/cherry-pick, cherry-pick) merge conflict in file
	| | * e7f0e30 added file for cherry_pick
	| |/  
	|/|   
	* | 286a273 added readme
	|/  
	| * c5c3da1 (origin/foo, foo) file2 for demonstration of cherry-pick
	| * c361f2e foo
	|/  
	* 25f7328 file

	$ cat file
	.
	bar
	.
	.
	bar

We can see that branch `bar` was merged into `master`. Now it's time to do the same with `foo`.

	$ git merge foo
	Auto-merging file
	CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file
	Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

We have a conflict! We need to somehow resolve it.

> You can always abort merge with `git merge --abort`

Text editor way
---------------

In case of conflict, git puts changes into a file like this:

	$ cat file
	.
	<<<<<<< HEAD
	bar
	.
	.
	bar
	=======
	foo
	.
	foo
	.
	>>>>>>> foo

The `=======` separates two versions while `HEAD` being current branch and `foo` the merged branch (`foo`). All you have to is to modified the file into what you want it to look like, so I'll do for example this:

	$ cat file
	.
	foobar
	.
	foo
	bar

After you are done with manual merge, you need to mark conflict as resolved and commit the merge:

	$ git add file
	$ git commit -m "Merge branch 'foo'"
	[master b702845] Merge branch 'foo'

Let's check it out:

	$ git log --all --graph --oneline --decorate
	*   b702845 (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'foo'
	|\  
	| * c5c3da1 (origin/foo, foo) file2 for demonstration of cherry-pick
	| * c361f2e foo
	* |   05dbdf3 Merge branch 'bar'
	|\ \  
	| * | bfb5647 (origin/bar, bar) bar
	| |/  
	* | c5d665f (origin/master, origin/HEAD) fixed readme a bit
	| | * 4909911 (origin/cherry-pick, cherry-pick) merge conflict in file
	| | * e7f0e30 added file for cherry_pick
	| |/  
	|/|   
	* | 286a273 added readme
	|/  
	* 25f7328 file

We now have merge both `bar` and `foo` into the master, in the process we resolved conflict between them.

Mergetool way
-------------

> Now is probably a good time to check if you have GUI tools configured. `99-GitConfiguration` will help you with that.

We throw away the last commit (the merge of `foo`), so we can do it again, this time using merge tool.

	$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
	HEAD is now at 05dbdf3 Merge branch 'bar'

> `git reset --hard` basically throws away everything after specified commit and `HEAD~1` is shorthand for `one-before-last` commit

Now do the merge

	$ git merge foo
	Auto-merging file
	CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file
	Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
	$ git mergetool

Now resolve conflict in your favourite mergetool you configured and commit the result.

Cherry-pick
===========

> Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits

We want to pick specific change from branch `cherry-pick`. We don't want whole branch, just single commit.

	$ git checkout cherry-pick 
	Switched to branch 'cherry-pick'
	Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/cherry-pick'.
	$ ls
	cherry_pick_this_file  file  readme.md
	$ git log --name-status cherry_pick_this_file
	commit e7f0e306d0b5639bb6f56b1897e6dfdf319d39b7
	Author: Wolf <wolf@wolfsden.cz>
	Date:   Mon Apr 11 10:37:49 2016 +0200

		added file for cherry_pick

	A       cherry_pick_this_file

We want to merge file `cherry_pick_this_file` into `master`. We found out that it was added in commit e7f0e306d0b5639bb6f56b1897e6dfdf319d39b7. We can therefore try to merge it into `master`.

	$ git cherry-pick e7f0e306d0b5639bb6f56b1897e6dfdf319d39b7
	[master 145a1b2] added file for cherry_pick
	 Date: Mon Apr 11 10:37:49 2016 +0200
	 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
	 create mode 100644 cherry_pick_this_file
	$ ls
	cherry_pick_this_file  file  file2  readme.md

We've got the `cherry_pick_this_file` without merging changes done to `file`.

> `git-cherry-pick` is crazy useful for applying hot-fixes to multiple branches. You can develop it on one branch (e.g. Baseline) and then `cherry-pick` just that one commit into maintenance branches.
