* Show commit logs

You can use `git log` for inspecting history of a repository, individual files or even specific lines in a file! But remember, this text is just a brief introduction into `git-log`, so go see documentation for more details if you need to.

Now, let me just start this with a quick remark that very few of you will likely use `git-log` on a daily basis. But still, it's good to know how to use it.

It's simplest form `git log` we already know, so let's try something more compact

	$ git log --oneline
	6cfa070 Removal of console application
	c72c6d6 My first lab commit 2
	b76b4f2 My first lab commit 1
	0f412a0 First commit and comment for it

we can see history of current branch. Now, you can provide branch

	$ git log --oneline my_apple_app
	5a1710a OS X version
	6cfa070 Removal of console application
	c72c6d6 My first lab commit 2
	b76b4f2 My first lab commit 1
	0f412a0 First commit and comment for it

specific file(s)

	$ git log --oneline MyWindowsApp/code.txt
	c72c6d6 My first lab commit 2
	b76b4f2 My first lab commit 1

or even directory

	$ git log --oneline MyWindowsApp
	c72c6d6 My first lab commit 2
	b76b4f2 My first lab commit 1

But this is all just iterations of the same, so let's try something more interesting.

	$ git mv MyWindowsApp/code.txt MyWindowsApp/dll.txt
	$ git commit -m "moved code into dll"
	[master eeab96e] moved code into dll
	 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
	 rename MyWindowsApp/{code.txt => dll.txt} (100%)
	$ git log --follow --oneline MyWindowsApp/dll.txt
	eeab96e moved code into dll
	c72c6d6 My first lab commit 2
	b76b4f2 My first lab commit 1

We can see that the file was tracked even across renames! Using `--follow` we can even list history of deleted files:

	$ git log --follow --oneline -- MyConsoleApp/console.txt
	6cfa070 Removal of console application
	c72c6d6 My first lab commit 2
	b76b4f2 My first lab commit 1

We can also add `-p` flag and let git list diff for complete history of the file across renames.

	$ git log --follow -p MyWindowsApp/dll.txt

> I'm not using `--oneline` here, since without colors it gets kinda dense.

More informations
-----------------

I recommend checking [git-log documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) for more details, there is a **lot** of options for `git log`.
